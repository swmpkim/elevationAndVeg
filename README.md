# Elevation and Veg data exploration app  

This is the code repository for an app to interactively explore elevation data, stored in a csv file with one row per plot per date, and one column per elevation reading; and vegetation data from Excel files generated during (and updated after) the [Namaste project](https://nerrssciencecollaborative.org/project/Peter20 "Science Collaborative website for Namaste project"). The app itself is online at [nerrscdmo.shinyapps.io/elevationAndVeg](nerrscdmo.shinyapps.io/elevationAndVeg) .  

A vegetation-only version of this app is available at  [nerrscdmo.shinyapps.io/vegData_exploration](nerrscdmo.shinyapps.io/vegData_exploration) .
